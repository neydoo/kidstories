        A shepherd-boy, who watched a flock of sheep near a village, brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out, \"Wolf! Wolf!\" and when his neighbours came to help him, laughed at them for their pains. The Wolf, however, did truly come at last. The Shepherd-boy, now really alarmed, shouted in an agony of terror: \"Pray, do come and help me; the Wolf is killing the sheep\"; but no one paid any heed to his cries, nor rendered any assistance. The Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock. There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.

    Once upon a time, a wise lion lived in the jungle.  He was always respected for his intelligence and kindness.  All the animals used to go to him to discuss their problems.  He was the best king they could ever have.
    a few miles away from the jungle there was an empty cave.  All the animals knew it was deserted and nobody lived there.  But, one day they saw a monster entering the cave.  The monster was very evil and wanted to eat the animals but nobody would talk to him.  So, he decided to invite all the animals to the cave for a party and later eat them.  He knew the king of the jungle was very wise and he would not allow any animal to come to the party so he did not invite him.  He also knew how brave and strong the lion was so he was really scared of him.
    All the animals got ready for the party and gathered at a place to go to the cave.  But, Zebra pointed out that the King of the Jungle was missing, so they all went to the lion to ask him to go with them. Lion saw all the animals together and asked them where they were going.  When they told him about the party he immediately understood the monster’s plan so he told all the animals to wait here and he went to the cave alone.  Seeing the lion, the monster got really scared and tried to run but the lion caught him.  The monster asked for forgiveness but the lion only forgave him on the condition that he would leave the cave and never come back.  So, the monster agreed and left.
    All the animals thanked the lion for saving them from the monster and lived happily together

    A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were friends. The Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields. The Town Mouse came and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.

    The flavour was not much to the taste of the guest and presently he broke out with “My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants. Now, you should just see how I fare! My larder is a regular horn of plenty. You must come and stay with me and I promise you shall live on the fat of the land.\"

    So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.

    The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided. But before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and someone came in. The two Mice scampered off and hid in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole. Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again. But someone else came in, and off they scuttled again. This was too much for the visitor. \"Goodbye,\" said he, \"I'm off. You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace.\"

    Once upon a time in a castle there lived a spoiled, selfish prince. One cold rainy night a haggard old woman knocked on the door, seeking shelter from the bitter cold in exchange for a single rose. Repulsed by her appearance, the Prince turned her away. She warned him not to be deceived by appearances, for true beauty lies far within. When he scorned her again, the woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress. The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late, she had seen there was no love in his heart.

    She transformed him into a hideous beast and placed a powerful spell on the castle and all who lived there. The Beast concealed himself in his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world. The rose she had given him would bloom for many years. If he could learn to love and earn another's love in return by the time the last petal fell, the curse would be broken. If not, he would be doomed to remain a Beast for all time.

    Nearby, a girl named Belle lived in a small French town with her father, Maurice, who was an inventor. Belle loved reading because the stories in her books took her on adventures she couldn't get in her small town.

    One day, Maurice hitched the wagon to their horse, Phillippe, and took his invention through the woods to enter it into the fair. But along the way, they got lost. Phillippe got spooked and bolted, leaving Maurice alone. Then, wolves attacked! Maurice had to seek shelter in a dark and gloomy castle.

    Inside the castle, Maurice was amazed to find that the servants were enchanted objects. The clock, candelabra and teapot could all talk! They put him by the fire to warm up, but just then the master of the castle, a huge and terrifying beast, came in.

    \"I-I didn't mean any harm,\" Maurice stammered. \"I just needed a place to stay.\"

    \"I'll give you a place to stay,\" the Beast growled, and he locked Maurice in the dungeon!

    Meanwhile, Gaston, a brutish man from town who thought Belle was very beautiful, called on Belle at her house. He'd arranged everything in her front yard for their wedding, then he went inside and asked her to marry him. Belle politely declined.

    Gaston was humiliated and upset. \"I'll have Belle for my wife,\" he vowed, \"Make no mistake about that.\"

    When they'd all gone, Belle went outside again to do her chores. Just then, Phillippe came trotting up, without Maurice. Belle knew something had happened to her father, so she got on Phillippe and he took her back to the castle.

    Belle crept inside, calling, \"Hello? Is anyone there? I'm looking for my father.\" She followed a flickering light to the dungeon, where she found Maurice locked in a cell.

    \"No, you must go!\" Maurice tried to warn Belle to run, but just then the Beast found her. Belle offered to take her father's place as the Beast's prisoner and he accepted. He freed Maurice and then showed Belle upstairs to her own room.

    \"The castle is your home now, you may go anywhere you like,\" the Beast said. \"Except the West Wing. It is forbidden!\"

    The Beast asked Belle to join him for dinner that night, but she refused. She'd just lost her father and her freedom all in one day and she was very upset. But later that night when she grew hungry she crept downstairs and the servants were happy to serve her dinner, with singing and dancing.

    Meanwhile, Maurice had made it back to town and begged the townspeople to help him free Belle from the horrible Beast. But the townspeople laughed and called him \"Crazy Old Maurice.\" But Gaston hatched a plan to get Belle to marry him.

    After dinner, Belle wanted to explore the castle so she slipped away from the servants and crept up to the West Wing. She was startled to find ripped curtains and broken furniture. She also found a rose glowing under a glass dome. Some of the petals had started to fall. She reached out as if to touch it. But just then the Beast came into the room.

    \"What are you doing!\" he bellowed. \"Do you know what you could have done? Get out! Get OUT!\"

    Belle was so frightened that she ran right out of the castle, got on Phillippe and rode out into the woods. But in the woods, wolves attacked! Belle fought them off with a big stick, but then the Beast jumped in to protect them. He fought off the pack of wolves but was badly hurt. He staggered and fell in the snow.

    Belle could have left, but she was kind and took the Beast back to the castle to tend his wounds.

    \"By the way, thank you for saving my life,\" she said.

    \"You're welcome,\" the Beast replied.

    After that, Belle saw a gentler side of the Beast. He gave her his entire library of books because he knew she liked to read.  They went for walks in the snowy garden and read by the fire. One night, the Beast put on an elegant dinner and afterwards they danced in the ballroom. He asked Belle if she was happy there with him. She said she was but she missed her father.

    So the Beast showed her the Enchanted Mirror, which would show her whatever she wanted to see. Belle asked to see her father. The mirror showed Maurice alone in the woods, lost, cold and sick.

    The Beast knew what he had to do. He released Belle, giving her freedom again.

    \"You must go to him,\" he said. He gave Belle the Enchanted Mirror, so she would always have a way to look back on him and remember.

    \"Thank you for understanding how much he needs me,\" she said. Belle found her father in the woods and got him back home to warm up. He asked her how she had escaped the terrible Beast.

    \"I didn't escape Papa, he let me go,\" Belle said. \"He's different now.\" But before she could explain, there was a knock at the door. It was Gaston with the man from the asylum, come to take Maurice away.

    \"I can clear up this little misunderstanding,\" Gaston promised, \"If you marry me.\"

    \"I'll never marry you!\" Belle said. \"My father's not crazy and I'll prove it!\" Belle got the Enchanted Mirror and showed the townspeople an image of the Beast. They were afraid of him. \"Oh no, he's not dangerous,\" Belle assured them. \"He's really kind and gentle. He's my friend.\"

    Gaston was jealous of the way she spoke of the Beast. He snatched the mirror and rallied the townspeople to march on the castle and kill the Beast. They locked Belle and Maurice in their cottage, but Chip had stowed away in Belle's bag, and he helped them escape so they could go warn the Beast.

    The enchanted servants had fought off the townspeople at the castle, but Gaston slipped upstairs and found the Beast. He shot him with an arrow and the Beast fell out the window onto the roof. Gaston followed, but the Beast wasn't fighting back. Without Belle, he no longer cared about anything.

    But just then, he heard Belle's voice, shouting, \"No!\" Hearing her voice filled him with hope and he found the will to defend himself. He grabbed Gaston and said, \"Leave and never come back.\" Then he climbed up the roof to the balcony where Belle was waiting. But Gaston surprised them and stabbed the beast!

    Gaston slipped on the wet roof and fell. Before the Beast could fall, Belle grabbed him by the collar and pulled him over the railing.

    \"At least I got to see you one last time,\" the Beast whispered.

    \"No,\" Belle cried, \"Please don't leave me. I love you.\"

    As she spoke, the last petal fell from the enchanted rose. Suddenly, magical sparkles began to swirl around the Beast. He rose into the air and turned slowly in a shower of light. Belle watched as he transformed into a man! He stood and turned to Belle.

    \"Belle, it's me!\" he exclaimed. She looked into his eyes and realized it was true.

    \"It is you!\" she said. Prince Adam kissed her. All over the castle, the enchanted servants were turning back into their human selves. Belle had broken the curse!

    Belle and Prince Adam were married, and Belle became the princess of the castle. And they all lived happily ever after. The End.

    Long ago and far away there lived a good king and queen.  The people loved them and their lives would have been very happy if only they had had a child.
    Years went by and then, one spring, when they thought all hope was gone, the queen gave birth to a baby girl. The whole kingdom rejoiced – the young princess was such a lovely baby and they called her Aurora.
    Everyone was excitedly preparing for the christening of the new baby princess. Anyone who was important in the land had been invited to the christening, including all the good fairies. And everyone else in the kingdom was to have a day off work and a great big feast with cakes and jellies!

    But, unfortunately, there was one important fairy that the king and queen had forgotten to invite… Grizzlestinki!

    Grizzelstinki was a scary fairy who lived up in the mountains. People told scary stories about her, frightening their children into being good by threatening to send for her if they were naughty!
    On the day of the christening, everyone had a wonderful celebration at the palace and there were lots of lovely presents for the baby. One person gave her a tiny teddy bear to cuddle, another gave her a rattle to play with and another gave her a story book for her to read when she was older. But the most magical presents of all were from the good fairies… One gave her beauty, one gave her a sweet nature, one a lovely voice, one charm, one kindness and one a sense of humour.

    “Isn’t our daughter lucky to have such lovely presents,” said the king turning to the queen.
    “Don’t be so sure,” said a frightening voice suddenly! A cold wind blew through the hall, the door burst open and there was Grizzelstinki herself!
    Grizzelstinki marched up to the baby princess and, as she passed, everyone held their noses as the smell was quite terrible.
    “I haven’t given her my present yet,” Grizzelstinki growled. “My present is that when she is older she will cut her finger and fall asleep… Forever!”
    Grizzelstinki laughed a terrible laugh and disappeared in a puff of smoke!
    There was a stunned silence around the palace until one of the good fairies laid her hand on the baby’s head… “I promise that she will not sleep forever,” she said. “She will only sleep for a hundred years.”
    The king and queen were still very worried so they decided to ban anything sharp in the kingdom that the princess might cut her finger on.
    Years went by and as Aurora got older the people almost forgot the curse that was upon her.
    One day, when she was alone and bored, Aurora decided to explore all the rooms in the palace. She went from room to room, exploring all over the palace until she got to an old stone staircase. Up and up the stone staircase she climbed until she came to a room right at the top of a tower. It was the only room in the palace she’d never been in! So she peeped inside and, to her surprise, there was a little old woman busily spinning wool on a spindle.
    “Hello my dear princess,” the little old woman said. “I am pleased to meet you.” And she stood up and tried to curtsey.
    “No, no, please sit down, I don’t want you to hurt your back,” said Aurora, hurrying forward. “Can you tell me what you are doing up here in the tower all alone?”
    “Only spinning silk, my dear, to make you a lovely dress,” the little old woman replied.
    “May I have a go please?” Aurora asked politely.
    “Of course my dear,” the little old woman said, and she chuckled quietly to herself. “Let me show you how.”
    Aurora sat down with the spindle in her hand and the little old woman began to show her how to spin silk.
    Suddenly a sharp pain shot through Aurora’s arm as a spike on the spindle cut her finger. It was a curse! Grindlestinki’s curse was upon her!
    Suddenly the little old lady threw off her cloak and stood up straight, it was Grindlestinki all along! She laughed a wicked laugh and ran away leaving the princess all alone.
    Because of Grindlestinki’s birthday curse, Princess Aurora fell into a deep sleep.
    And all across the palace, people started to fall asleep too!
    The cook in the kitchen fell asleep, the guards at the palace gates fell flat on their noses and began to snore, the maids curled up to sleep with their feather dusters still in their hands, and the palace Gardner fell asleep out in the garden. (The palace cat just carried on sleeping because she was sleeping anyway)! Even the king and queen feel asleep!
    Over the years, weeds, brambles and plants grew up over the palace and a deep dark wood encircled. Everyone was asleep, even the gardener so there was no one to cut them down! As the palace disappeared behind the woods the people outside began to forget it had ever been there.
    One spring day a handsome young prince was riding his horse in the woods around the forgotten palace. He had heard the tale of a beautiful sleeping princess and a terrible birthday curse.
    The wood was so thick that the prince had to get off his horse and walk – he even had to hack through the dense undergrowth with his sword!
    Then, as he was cutting through the undergrowth, his sword suddenly struck some stone; it was the wall of a palace!
    Could the stories be true? Could this be the forgotten palace?
    The prince wanted to find out so he began to climb up the palace wall.
    And when he reached the top he couldn’t believe his eyes!
    There before him lay a palace asleep; the guards still snoring, the maids and the cook sleeping peacefully and the gardener still asleep in the overgrown garden (and the cat still curled up asleep of course). Even the king and queen were still asleep!
    With his heart beating quickly the prince began to explore the palace. In every room people slept so he climbed higher and higher, looking through every door… Until he came to a tiny room at the top of a tower with a stone staircase.
    He pushed open the door and, much to his joy, there lay the beautiful Princess Aurora!
    The handsome prince leaned down and kissed her… And at that moment she woke up… And the whole palace woke up with her… Yawning and stretching and wondering how long they’d been asleep.
    The cook woke up in his kitchen, the maids woke up still holding their feather dusters, the gardener woke up out in the garden and the King and Queen woke up on their thrones. (But the cat stayed asleep – she always sleeps)!
    The king and queen were so grateful to the prince for waking up their daughter and everyone else in the palace that they let him live in the palace with them.
    They were overjoyed and everyone lived happily ever after!

    The end.

    Once upon a time, there were two princesses named Anna and Elsa. They were sisters and the best of friends. Elsa was born with magic ice powers, and the sisters loved building snowmen and playing on the ice Elsa made. One day, while playing, Elsa slipped and accidentally struck Anna in the head with her ice magic. She started to get very cold and weak, so their parents took her to the trolls, who had their own magic.

    The trolls removed the ice from Anna's head, but they had to take all memory of Elsa's magic with it. So Anna didn't remember what had happened, or that Elsa had magic at all. To protect Elsa's secret, the King and Queen closed the castle gates and limited the people who came inside. Elsa didn't want to hurt her sister again, so she stayed in her room instead of going out to play with Anna. This made Anna very sad and lonely.

    Anna kept trying to get Elsa to come out to play, but Elsa's powers were growing stronger, and she didn't want to hurt her sister, so she stayed in her room. Even after the King and Queen were lost in a storm at sea, Elsa didn't come out.

    Years passed, and it was time for Elsa to be crowned Queen of Arendelle. They opened the castle gates for only one day to let people in for the ceremony. After the ceremony, there was a big party in the ballroom, where the sisters spoke for the first time in many years. Anna liked the open gates and having her sister back. Anna also met Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, who was handsome and charming and seemed to like Anna a lot. He asked her to marry him! And...Anna said yes!

    Anna asked Elsa for her blessing for the marriage, but Elsa said no! She said, \"You can't marry a man you just met!\"

    As the sisters argued, Elsa lost control of her emotions. When she became upset, her powers were harder to control, and she shot ice from her hands into the ballroom floor. Just like that, everyone knew her secret. Panicked and scared, she ran away into the mountains. Her fear caused an eternal winter to fall over Arendelle when it should have been the middle of summer.

    Anna went after her sister, to talk to her and get her to bring back summer. Along the way, she met Kristoff, the ice harvester, and his reindeer Sven. He agreed to bring her up the North mountain to find Elsa. They also met Olaf, an enchanted snowman that Elsa had brought to life. He helped them find the huge ice palace Elsa had built on the mountain.

    Anna tried to get Elsa to come back to Arendelle with her, but Elsa liked being alone on the mountain, where she could let her powers be free and didn't have to be afraid of hurting anyone. Anna told her that Arendelle was stuck in winter and they needed her to bring back summer. Elsa got upset and scared, and lost control of her emotions again, accidentally striking Anna in the heart with her magic without realizing it.

    Anna still didn't want to leave without Elsa, so Elsa created a big snowman to make them go, thinking Anna and Arendelle were better off without her. After escaping the snowman, Kristoff realized Anna was getting cold and weak, and her hair was turning white. He knew that meant Elsa had struck Anna with her magic, and he brought her to the trolls, who were his adopted family.

    But Grandpoppy Troll said he couldn't help her. The ice was in her heart, and only an act of true love could thaw a frozen heart. They suggested True Love's Kiss. Anna thought she was in love with Hans, so Kristoff rushed her back to the castle.

    Meanwhile, Hans took some men up the North mountain to look for Anna and Elsa. They captured Elsa and brought her back to the castle, demanding that she bring back summer. But she told them, \"Don't you see? I can't. I don't know how.\" Elsa escaped the castle using her magic, running out onto the frozen water of the bay.

    When Kristoff dropped Anna off at the castle, Hans refused to kiss her. He said he didn't really love her, he was only pretending so he could have the power to rule Arendelle. He locked her in a room in the castle, where she became weaker and colder, and would soon turn to solid ice. But Olaf found her and let her out of the room. He looked out the window and saw Kristoff rushing back to the castle. Elsa's fear was making a huge storm cloud over the castle, and Kristoff wanted to help and protect Anna any way he could because he loved her.

    Anna realized she loved him too, and with Olaf's help, ran out onto the frozen water of the bay to meet Kristoff for True Love's Kiss that would save her from freezing to solid ice.

    Prince Hans had followed Queen Elsa out onto the ice and told her that she'd struck Anna with her power. Elsa was devastated. All that she'd done to protect her sister had failed. Hans drew his sword and held it up above Elsa, intending to strike her.

    Anna heard Prince Hans draw his sword and saw him raise it above her sister's head. She couldn't let him hurt Elsa! Instead of saving herself, Anna turned and put herself between Hans and Elsa to save her sister. As Hans brought his sword down, Anna turned to solid ice, and the blade shattered on the enchanted ice of her hand, knocking Hans backwards.

    Elsa looked up to see her sister, frozen. She cried and hugged her icy form. But, putting herself between Hans and Elsa to save her sister and sacrificing herself was an act of true love! So Anna began to thaw and came back to life. The sisters hugged, and Elsa realized that love was the key to thawing the winter. She thought about how much she loved her sister and removed all the ice and snow from Arendelle.

    They sent Prince Hans back to the Southern Isles for his big brothers to deal with. Kristoff was made Arendelle's Official Ice Master and Deliverer, and Elsa kept the castle gates open. Everyone knew her secret now, and the people of the kingdom still loved her. The sisters were best friends again, and they all lived Happily Ever After.

    Once upon a time, there lived a lovely girl named Cinderella. Sadly, her father passed away, leaving Cinderella with her stepmother and two stepsisters. They were very cruel to her and treated her terribly, making her work cooking and cleaning all day long. But Cinderella was cheerful nonetheless, and she was friends with the house mice and sang with the birds outside her window.

    One day, the Prince of the kingdom decided he would host a ball at the palace, in order to choose a bride. Invitations were sent to every available lady in the kingdom. One invitation came to Cinderella's house. Cinderella thought this meant she, too, would be able to go to the ball. How wonderful that would be! To escape the dull drudgery of her life for just one night!

    She had a gown of her mother's that she would fix up with her needle and thread. It would be nothing fancy, but she certainly couldn't go to a ball in her old raggedy dress she wore around the house.

    But her stepmother and stepsisters scorned her. \"Of course you can go,\" her stepmother said. \"If you finish all your chores.\"

    So all day long, her cruel stepsisters made extra work for Cinderella. Whenever she finished cleaning up something, they'd make it messy again, so she didn't have any time to fix up her mother's dress she wanted to wear to the ball.

    At the end of the long day, Cinderella sighed. \"Oh well, I guess there will be no ball for me.\"

    But, her mouse and bird friends had spent all afternoon working, too. They saw what Cinderella's stepmother was doing to her and they wanted to help. So, using the sketch Cinderella had made of what she wanted the dress to look like, they cut and stitched and strung pearls and ribbons and fixed up her dress for her!

    Cinderella was so excited when she saw what they had done. \"Thank you so much my friends!\" she exclaimed, hugging them all. She quickly dressed and hurried downstairs, where her stepmother and stepsisters were about to get into their carriage to go to the ball.

    Even though her gown was not as fancy as her stepsisters', she still looked beautiful. Her stepmother wanted one of her own daughters to become Queen, so she didn't want Cinderella to go to the ball and catch the Prince's attention. She accused Cinderella of stealing the pearl necklace she was wearing. Her stepsister snatched it off her neck and tore her dress too. They pulled at the ribbons and beads until her dress was in tatters. Then they got into the carriage and rode away, leaving Cinderella there alone.

    Defeated, sad and lonely, Cinderella rushed outside into the garden and sat on the ground, crying onto the stone bench.

    Suddenly, she realized she was not alone anymore. A kindly old woman was sitting on the bench, patting her arm. \"There, there, dear. It'll all be alright,\" she said.

    \"Who are you?\" Cinderella exclaimed.

    \"I'm your fairy Godmother of course! I'm here to help you.\"

    Her fairy Godmother knew Cinderella wanted to go to the ball, so she used her magic. With a wave of her wand and a Bippity Boppity Boo, she transformed a pumpkin from the garden into a carriage, two mice into horses to pull the carriage and a rabbit into a coachman to drive it! Then she turned to Cinderella. She waved her wand and Cinderella was suddenly dressed in a beautiful sparkly blue gown.

    \"Remember dear, the magic will only last until midnight!\" her fairy Godmother told Cinderella.

    At the palace, Cinderella marvelled at the beauty of the ballroom and the luxury of the other ladies. She was having such a lovely time just looking at everything. The Prince was swamped by all the ladies wanting his attention, but he noticed Cinderella wandering out by the balcony. He left all the other ladies and went to talk to her. Cinderella was very surprised, but she accepted when he asked her to dance.

    The Prince didn't leave her side all night. They talked and laughed and danced. Cinderella was having such a lovely evening, she lost all track of the time. Finally, she got a look at the clocktower. It was five minutes to midnight!

    \"I have to go!\" she exclaimed and rushed out.

    The Prince chased after her. \"Wait! I don't even know your name!\"

    On the steps, she lost one of her glass slippers, but she couldn't go back for it. She didn't want the Prince to see her when the magic spell wore off.

    She got home just in time. The carriage changed back into a pumpkin. The horses turned back into mice, the coachman back into a bunny and Cinderella was dressed in her ragged old dress again. The only thing she had left from her magical evening was one sparkling glass shoe.

    But, oh, what an amazing night! The memories would be enough to help her endure her stepfamily's cruelty for as long as she had to.

    But the Prince did not give up so easily. The next day, he sent his Governor to every home in the kingdom, carrying with him the glass slipper, the only clue the Prince had about the mystery lady he wanted to marry. Every lady who'd attended the ball tried it on.

    When the Governor came to Cinderella's house, her stepmother locked her in the attic so she couldn't try on the glass slipper. As her stepsisters tried to cram their big feet into the dainty glass shoe, Cinderella's mouse friends went on a dangerous mission. They snuck past the house cat and stole the key from her stepmother's room. They unlocked her door and Cinderella rushed downstairs just as the Governor was leaving.

    \"Wait, please! I'd like to try.\"

    Before she could try on the shoe, her stepmother tripped the Governor and the glass slipper shattered on the ground. He was devastated!

    \"Don't worry, sir,\" Cinderella said kindly. \"I have the other shoe.\"

    And so she did. She retrieved the other glass slipper from her bedroom and put it on.

    It fit her foot perfectly because it was made for her. The Governor knew this was the woman the Prince was looking for, so he whisked her off to the palace. As soon as the Prince saw her again, even in her ragged old dress, he knew she was the woman he'd fallen in love with. He asked her to marry him right there, and she said yes.

    Cinderella became Princess of the kingdom and eventually Queen. She brought her mouse friends to live at the palace with her, and they all lived happily ever after. The End.

    Once upon a time, a long time ago, there lived a spider named Anansi. Anansi's wife was a very good cook. But always, Anansi loved to taste the food that others in the village made for themselves and for their families.
    One day, he stopped by Rabbit's house. The rabbit was his good friend.
    \"There are greens in your pot,\" cried Anansi excitedly. Anansi loved greens.
    \"They are not quite done,\" said Rabbit. \"But they will be soon. Stay and eat with me.\"
    \"I would love to, Rabbit, but I have some things to do,\" Anansi said hurriedly. If he waited at Rabbit's house, Rabbit would certainly give him jobs to do. \"I know,\" said Anansi. \"I'll spin a web. I'll tie one end around my leg and one end to your pot. When the greens are done, tug on the web, and I'll come running!\"
    Rabbit thought that was a great idea. And so it was done.
    \"I smell beans,\" Anansi sniffed excitedly as he ambled along. \"Delicious beans, cooking in a pot.\"
    \"Come eat our beans with us,\" cried the monkeys. \"They are almost done.\"
    \"I would love to Father Monkey,\" said Anansi. And again, Anansi suggested he spin a web, with one end tied around his leg, and one end tied to the big bean pot.
    Father Monkey thought that was a great idea. All his children thought so, too. And so it was done.
    \"I smell sweet potatoes,\" Anansi sniffed happily as he ambled along. \"Sweet potatoes and honey, I do believe!\"
    \"Anansi,\" called his friend Hog. \"My pot is full of sweet potatoes and honey! Come share my food with me.\"
    \"I would love to,\" said Anansi. And again, Anansi suggested he spin a web, with one end tied around his leg, and one end tied to the sweet potato pot.
    His friend Hog thought that was a great idea. And so it was done.
    By the time Anansi arrived at the river, he had one web tied to each of his eight legs.
    \"This was a wonderful idea,\" Anansi told himself proudly. \"I wonder whose pot will be ready first?\"
    Just then, Anansi felt a tug at his leg. \"Ah,\" said Anansi. \"That is the web string tied to Rabbit's greens.\" He felt another. And another. Anansi has pulled three ways at once.
    \"Oh dear,\" said Anansi as he felt the fourth web string pull.
    Just then, he felt the fifth web string tug. And the sixth. And the seventh. And the eighth. Anansi was pulled this way and that way, as everyone pulled on the web strings at once. His legs were pulled thinner and thinner. Anansi rolled and tugged himself into the river. When all the webs had washed away, Anansi pulled himself painfully up on shore.
    \"Oh my, oh my,\" sighed Anansi. \"Perhaps that was not such a good idea after all.\"
    To this day, Anansi the Spider has eight very thin legs. And he never got any food that day at all.

    Once upon a time, there lived a young husband and wife in a small village in Africa. For some time now, the husband had not been happy with his marriage. He began to come home late from working in the fields. His wife thought he was the most wonderful man. But she was unhappy, too. His behavior was making her miserable.
    Finally, she went to the oldest man in her villge, the village elder. The elder was sad to hear her marriage was not a happy one. He had married them only two years before. At the time, he was sure that the marriage would be a good one.
    \"Of course I will end your marriage if that is what you want,\" he told the young wife, after listening patiently for a while. \"You will be free to marry again. But is that really what you want?\"
    \"I want my husband to be loving,\" she said. \"I want to be loving. We are both miserable.\"
    \"I think I can help you,\" the elder said slowly. \"I can prepare a secret potion that will change your husband into a loving man.\"
    \"Prepare this magic potion at once!\" the young wife cried out excitedly.
    \"I could make it,\" he said sadly. \"But I am missing an important ingredient. I am too old to get this ingredient for you. You must bring it to me.\"
    \"What do you need?\" the young wife asked eagerly. \"I'll bring it today.\"
    \"I need a single whisker taken from a living lion to make the potion work.\"
    Her eyes widened in alarm. She bit her bottom lip. She straightened her shoulders. \"I'll get it for you,\" she nodded.
    The next morning, the young wife carried a huge piece of raw meat down to the river where lions sometimes came to drink. She hid behind a tree and waited. After waiting many hours, a lion ambled down to the river to have a drink. He sniffed at the raw meat. In three bites, the meat was gone. He raised his mighty head. He knew she there. The young wife held her breath. The mighty lion moved slowly back into the forest and disappeared.
    The next day, the young wife came again. This time, the lion appeared quite quickly. This continued for many days. Days became weeks. Each day, the woman crept from her hiding place behind the tree, moving closer and closer to the lion.
    At the end of four weeks, she moved quietly next to the lion and sat silently while he ate. Her hand shaking, she reached slowly out and pulled a whisker from his chin. Holding per prize firmly in one hand, she sat frozen until the lion had disappeared back into the forest.
    She ran to the elder, waving her whisker. \"I have it,\" she shouted. \"I have it!\"
    The elder was in awe when he heard her story. \"You do not need magic to change your husband back into the loving man he once was. You are brave enough to pull a whisker from the chin of a living lion. It took cleverness and bravery to do what you have done. Can you not use that same patience and courage and wit with your husband?
    \"But the potion,\" the young wife said eagerly. \"Would not that work as well?\"
    \"Perhaps,\" the elder told her. \"But it would not last. Trust me, my child. Show your husband each day that you love him. Share his problems. Make him feel welcome. Make him feel wanted and needed. Give him time to change and see what happens.\"
    The young wife went home and followed the elder's advice. Slowly, her husband began to return from the fields with the other men of the village He began to look glad to see her. Within a year, their life was a happy one.

    "body"=>"
    Aharsi the big Bengal Tiger was having a good think. It was winter and he was still getting used to the feeling of ice on the pads of his paws. He shivered a little, missing the warm ooze of mangrove mud. Aharsi was missing lots of things. He missed the way the sun made his coat glow a regal orange, or how the glare of midday brightness made his black stripes look so bold and striking like black lightening bolts. He missed dozing in the evening heat and catching the last shafts of sunlight as they cut through the jungle vines. He wondered if he would ever again hear Doyel birds chattering in the trees, or catch the scent of ripe mangoes on the breeze. It was these fleeting, poignant moments that the Bengal tiger was trying so hard to picture in his mind. Aharsi missed his home. His whiskers bristled as he let out a big sigh, sending the starlings that had been pecking at the frozen ground scattering up into the grey sky. Three hours had passed, and despite his intense concentration, all the tiger had managed to remember was some vague half images of mangoes and mangroves. He was worried that he was forgetting about his old home all together.

    When Aharsi first arrived at the zoo in England with his mother and father, everything was so exciting. He lapped it all up; his amber eyes burned with curiosity as he jumped from tree to tree or smelled each flower or pawed at each tiny insect.

    ‘Now just calm down, Aharsi,’ his mother would say. ‘You have come a long way. There is plenty of time to explore; now you must rest.’

    But the young tiger was too busy to rest. There were new animals to meet, new trees to climb. There was so much to learn about his new home. Before the sun went down on that first day, Aharsi had bounded around all of the animals’ cages, asking them question after question, absorbing the strange exotic colours of the paradise birds and smelling the sweet and unfamiliar smell of the hay in the rhino stalls. But the more he explored, the more Aharsi realised how different his new home was to where he’d come from. And now the young tiger was worried that he’d lost all of the precious memories he had of his homeland. He was worried that he had forgotten all about being a Bengal Tiger.

    Aharsi squeezed his eyes closed and flicked his tail purposefully from side to side: ‘Remember,’ he told himself. ‘Try to think harder!’

    Hours passed, the day grew dimmer and the rest of the animals started to settle down in the twilight. After a while, Aharsi felt someone looking at him. He opened one eye, keen to stay as focused as he could on reclaiming his lost memories. It was Zody the Leopard.

    ‘What are yoooouuu doing?’ came the deep, purring voice.

    ‘I’m remembering,’ Aharsi answered. ‘Now if you don’t mind…’ Aharsi closed his eye once more and tried to concentrate even harder.

    ‘Reeeemembering?’ asked Zody.

    ‘Yes. I’ve forgotten all about being a Bengal Tiger, and where I’ve come from, so I’m trying to remember it before it’s all gone forever. Now if you don’t mind…’

    Once again Aharsi squeezed his eyes shut and tried to summon images from his homeland.

    ‘You won’t get faaaar with your eyes closed,’ said Zody.

    Aharsi opened his eyes wide and looked quite annoyed. ‘I won’t get anywhere unless you leave me alone to think!’ he said. ‘You wouldn’t understand anyway, you’re not even a tiger, let alone a Bengal Tiger! You’re a leopard!’

    ‘You silly animal!’ said Zody, rattling with laughter. ‘Look there!’ She pointed to a shiny slick patch of ice on the hard ground.

    Aharsi stared back at Zody in some confusion. ‘I think you may have gone a bit bonkers, Zody,’ he said, and just then he almost wanted to laugh himself.

    ‘If you want to remember how to be a tiger,’ said Zody in a kind voice ‘just look.’

    ‘Fine, if you’ll leave me alone then I’ll look.’

    Aharsi bent his neck a little and peered into the glassy ice mirror on the ground. Zody purred over his shoulder.

    Aharsi looks into the ice‘What beautiful stripes you have,’ she said. ‘When I look into the mirror I see my spots. Nobody else has spots quite like mine. My mother had spots, and my mother’s mother, and my mother’s mother’s mother… all the way back to when my great great great Grandma prowled the grasses of South Africa!’

    Aharsi noticed Zody’s eyes get brighter as she pictured the sun baked savanna and plush green jungles of her home. ‘When I see my spots,’ she continued, ‘I see my whole history. And I will always have my spots.’ She winked at Aharsi. ‘After all,’ she said, ‘a leopard never changes its spots!’

    ‘But don’t you ever get homesick or sad?’ the young tiger asked in a slight mewl. ‘Everything is so different here.’

    ‘We all get homesick,’ Zody replied while pawing at the ice, ‘but look here at our reflections. We are not so very different. You are from Bengal and I am from Africa, but see how we have the same whiskers. And see here…’ Zody cut an impressive jagged line in the ice with her sharp claws and then raised them up so that they shone in the fading light. ‘We both have these,’ she said with a grin.

    Just then there was a great trumpeting sound from the elephant’s enclosure in the east corner of the zoo.

    ‘Well that’s not so amazing,’ said Aharsi. ‘We are both cats. But I’m nothing like the elephants over there, am I?’

    Zody giggled. ‘They might look different and sound different, but I’ll bet even elephants get homesick too. That is something you have in common.’

    Aharsi looked unsure as he thought that the elephants were far too big and strong to ever be sad. ‘I bet they still remember where they are from,’ he said. ‘My mother told me that an Elephant never forgets.’

    Zody hissed and giggled and rolled around on the hard ground. ‘That’s true!’ she admitted. ‘An elephant never forgets!’

    ‘And I bet the Zebras don’t get scared,’ Aharsi continued, still a little bit sulky but starting to smile at his friend’s antics.

    ‘Haven’t you seen them running from the zookeeper’s tractor?’ asked Zody

    ‘And… and the crocodiles? Do they get scared and sad too?’ Aharsi asked.

    ‘Haven’t you seen them hiding beneath the water?’ Zody replied as she gave her friend a playful bump with her nose. ‘We all miss home sometimes, Aharsi. But that is why we all look different. We are different so that we can remember. Look at me. I have this beautiful tail which reminds me that we leopards are the best at balancing up high in the trees.’

    Aharsi felt much better and soon began to rumble with a deep purr. ‘And I will always have my stripes for hiding in the tall grass. We tigers are the best hunters in all of Bengal!’

    ‘Your stripes go wherever you go, Aharsi,’ Zody said with a smile.

    ‘And when the elephants feel sad they can look at their trunks to remember that they are the best at splashing in the water,’ said Aharsi. ‘And when the crocodiles feel sad or scared they can look at their webbed feet and remember that they are the fastest in the river…’

    The young tiger trailed off a little, his eyes were growing heavy and he yawned without noticing. It was evening now and the zoo was alive with the crooning calls of countless animals. Some were stripey, some were spotty. Not any one of them was the same as the other. As night fell and a million stars filled the sky, Aharsi began to understand that though all of the animals were different, they all felt the same sometimes. That is when he knew he would never be alone, and that is when he knew he would always carry his home in his heart forever.

    Once on a time and twice on a time, and all times together as ever I heard tell of, there was a tiny lassie who would weep all day to have the stars in the sky to play with; she wouldn’t have this, and she wouldn’t have that, but it was always the stars she would have. So one fine day off she went to find them. And she walked and she walked and she walked, till by-and-by she came to a mill-dam.

    “Goode’en to ye,” says she, “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?”

    “Oh, yes, my bonnie lassie,” said the mill-dam. “They shine in my own face o’ nights till I can’t sleep for them. Jump in and perhaps you’ll find one.”

    So she jumped in, and swam about and swam about and swam about, but ne’er a one could she see. So she went on till she came to a brooklet.

    “Goode’en to ye, Brooklet, Brooklet,” says she; “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?”

    “Yes, indeed, my bonny lassie,” said the Brooklet. “They glint on my banks at night. Paddle about, and maybe you’ll find one.”

    So she paddled and she paddled and she paddled, but ne’er a one did she find. So on she went till she came to the Good Folk.

    “Goode’en to ye, Good Folk,” says she; “I’m looking for the stars in the sky to play with. Have ye seen e’er a one?”

    “Why, yes, my bonny lassie,” said the Good Folk. “They shine on the grass here o’ night. Dance with us, and maybe you’ll find one.”

    And she danced and she danced and she danced, but ne’er a one did she see. So down she sate; I suppose she wept.

    “Oh dearie me, oh dearie me,” says she, “I’ve swam and I’ve paddled and I’ve danced, and if ye’ll not help me I shall never find the stars in the sky to play with.”

    But the Good Folk whispered together, and one of them came up to her and took her by the hand and said, “If you won’t go home to your mother, go forward, go forward; mind you take the right road. Ask Four Feet to carry you to No Feet at all, and tell No Feet at all to carry you to the stairs without steps, and if you can climb that—”

    “Oh, shall I be among the stars in the sky then?” cried the lassie.

    “If you’ll not be, then you’ll be elsewhere,” said the Good Folk, and set to dancing again.

    So on she went again with a light heart, and by-and-by she came to a saddled horse, tied to a tree.

    “Goode’en to ye, Beast,” said she; “I’m seeking the stars in the sky to play with. Will you give me a lift, for all my bones are an-aching.”

    “Nay,” said the horse, “I know nought of the stars in the sky, and I’m here to do the bidding of the Good Folk, and not my own will.”

    “Well,” said she, “it’s from the Good Folk I come, and they bade me tell Four Feet to carry me to No Feet at all.”

    “That’s another story,” said he; “jump up and ride with me.”

    So they rode and they rode and they rode, till they got out of the forest and found themselves at the edge of the sea. And on the water in front of them was a wide glistening path running straight out towards a beautiful thing that rose out of the water and went up into the sky, and was all the colours in the world, blue and red and green, and wonderful to look at.

    “Now get you down,” said the horse; “I’ve brought ye to the end of the land, and that’s as much as Four Feet can do. I must away home to my own folk.”

    “But,” said the lassie, “where’s No Feet at all, and where’s the stair without steps?”

    “I know not,” said the horse, “it’s none of my business neither. So goode’en to ye, my bonny lassie;” and off he went.

    So the lassie stood still and looked at the water, till a strange kind of fish came swimming up to her feet.

    “Goode’en to ye, big Fish,” says she, “I’m looking for the stars in the sky, and for the stairs that climb up to them. Will ye show me the way?”

    “Nay,” said the Fish, “I can’t unless you bring me word from the Good Folk.”

    “Yes, indeed,” said she. “They said Four Feet would bring me to No Feet at all, and No Feet at all would carry me to the stairs without steps.”

    “Get on my back and hold fast.”
    “Ah, well,” said the Fish; “that’s all right then. Get on my back and hold fast.”

    And off he went—Kerplash!—into the water, along the silver path, towards the bright arch. And the nearer they came the brighter the sheen of it, till she had to shade her eyes from the light of it.

    And as they came to the foot of it, she saw it was a broad bright road, sloping up and away into the sky, and at the far, far end of it she could see wee shining things dancing about.

    “Now,” said the Fish, “here you are, and yon’s the stair; climb up, if you can, but hold on fast. I’ll warrant you find the stair easier at home than by such a way; ‘t was ne’er meant for lassies’ feet to travel;” and off he splashed through the water.

    So she clomb and she clomb and she clomb, but ne’er a step higher did she get: the light was before her and around her, and the water behind her, and the more she struggled the more she was forced down into the dark and the cold, and the more she clomb the deeper she fell.

    But she clomb and she clomb, till she got dizzy in the light and shivered with the cold, and dazed with the fear; but still she clomb, till at last, quite dazed and silly-like, she let clean go, and sank down—down—down.

    And bang she came on to the hard boards, and found herself sitting, weeping and wailing, by the bedside at home all alone.

    The King of Granada decided to marry. First, the news was told to his barber, then to the night watchman, and then to the oldest women in the city. The barber told all his customers, who told all their friends. The night watchman shouted the news in a loud voice, so that all the maidens were kept awake by thinking of the news. The old women constantly reminded the young that the king had decided to marry.
    The old women asked the barber, “How will the king choose a wife?” To which he replied: “To find a worthy woman, I am afraid I shall have great trouble.”
    “What, you?” exclaimed the women. “What have you got to do with providing the king with a wife?”
    “I am the only man permitted to rub the royal face,” said he. “And what’s more, I have a magic mirror. If any woman who is not thoroughly good looks into the mirror, the blemishes on her character will appear as so many spots on its glossy surface.”

    “Is this one of the conditions?” asked all.
    “That is the only condition,” replied the barber. “Any woman from eighteen years upwards is eligible, but they will have to justify their claim – each woman will have to gaze into the mirror with me by her side.”
    The one condition imposed on those who wanted to become Queen of Granada was made known. Strange to say, no woman came forward to the barber to have a look into the mirror.  Days and weeks went by, and the king was no closer to getting a wife. Some ladies would try to convince their friends to go before the mirror, but none seemed willing to take the step.
    The king was a very handsome man, and was loved by all his subjects. Therefore it was surprising that none of the lovely ladies who attended court should try to become his wife.  Many excuses were given. Some were already engaged to be married. Others claimed to be too proud to enter the barber’s shop. Still others assured their friends that they had decided it would be better to stay single.  The fathers of families were much annoyed at the apparent lack of ambition in their daughters, while the mothers were strangely silent on the matter.
    Every morning the king would ask the barber if any young lady had come forward to look into the mirror, but the answer was always the same – that many watched his shop to see if others went inside, but none had ventured in herself.
    “Ah, Granada, Granada!” exclaimed the king. “Is there no maiden in this land willing to offer herself to be the bride of the king? Kings I know in other lands have no trouble getting married. Why is this happening to me?

    “Your Majesty,” replied the barber, “There is one possibility. The shepherdess on the mountainside may brave the magic power of the mirror, but would you marry such a lowly one?”
    “Ask her to come” answered the king. “In the presence of my assembled court, let the gentle shepherdess look into the mirror, after you have told her of the risk of so doing.”
    So the barber brought the shepherdess to court. It was proclaimed throughout the city that a trial was going to be made, and the royal hall was soon filled with all the grand ladies and knights of the king’s household.
    When the shepherdess entered the royal presence, she felt very shy at being surrounded by so many riches. The king received her kindly, telling her that if she desired to be his wife she would have to gaze into the magic mirror. If she had done anything which was not consistent with a good and virtuous character, the mirror would show as many stains on its surface as there might be blemishes in her past.
    “Sir,” replied the shepherdess, “everyone makes mistakes and I am no different. I’ve made mistakes with my flock but I think they must forgive me because every day they let me take care of them and if they sense danger, they come to me for protection. I love my sheep and do my best for them. Truly I have no ambition to become queen, but I’m not afraid to look into that magic mirror.”
    

    Saying this, she walked up to the mirror and gazed into it, blushing slightly, perhaps at the sight of her own reflection.
    The court ladies surrounded her. When they saw that the magic mirror showed no spots on its surface, they snatched it from her, passing the mirror from one to another. They exclaimed, “Look! There are no spots when any of us look into the mirror either.  This is not a magic mirror – a trick has been played on us!”
    But the king said, “No ladies, it is not. But if you had been as confident about your characters as this shepherdess, who is now going to be my queen, you would not have refused to look into the mirror.  I know now that my bride is truly the best amongst you all”

    The grapes are hanging on the vine
    In purple bunches big and fine,
    And yellow pumpkins on the ground
    Are lying everywhere around.
    Upon the forest floor of brown
    The big ripe nuts come tumbling down,
    And in the orchard as you pass
    Ripe apples strew the tangled grass.

    Yes, autumn was here and sweet scented summer was gone from the pleasant meadow. And all the little folk were busy getting their winter homes in readiness for the long cold months.
    Mrs. Bunny was putting up crabapple jelly and preserved peaches and Mr. Bunny was storing carrots and cabbages away in the cellar of his little house in the Old Brier Patch.
    But isn’t it strange, it always happens that when you are busy somebody calls and then you have to stop and talk?
    Well, just as Mrs. Bunny took off the stove a steaming dish of peaches and set it out on the window sill to cool, Old Mother Magpie flew up.
    “Busy, I see,” she said, lifting up the little cover to take a sip of the peach juice with her long black bill.
    “You must put in more sugar, my dear Mrs. Bunny,” said the meddlesome old magpie, and then she undid her bonnet and sat down in the rocking chair.
    “Oh dear me,” thought Mrs. Bunny to herself. “Now, I suppose she will stay for the rest of the afternoon.” Poor Mrs. Bunny sighed, for she really wanted to finish her preserving. And, anyway, she didn’t like Old Mother Mischief very much and neither did anyone else.
    And then, who should come in but Professor Crow to tell Mrs. Bunny that her little Billy Bunny had missed a word in spelling that morning, and of course Mrs. Bunny had not wanted Old Mother Mischief to hear that, for she knew the meddlesome old magpie would tell everyone in the Friendly Forest and that would make her little bunny sad, indeed.

    Well, as luck would have it, kind Uncle Lucky drove up just then and as soon as he came into the room Old Mother Mischief said she had to be going. You see, she was afraid of Uncle Lucky, for although, he was a kind, generous old gentleman rabbit he had a will of his own and didn’t like the trouble that meddlesome folk could cause.

    But it was not Uncle Lucky that spoke up, it was none other than old wise Professor Crow.
    And this is what he said:
    “Now let me say before you go,”
    Exclaimed the wise Professor Crow,
    “A magpie is a chatty bird
    And often tells more than she’s heard.
    In fact she talks so loud and long
    You can’t tell if she’s right or wrong.”

    This made Old Mother Magpie so angry that she put on her bonnet and flew out of the window without even saying goodbye. 

    And, then, do you know what they all did?
    They all sat down at the table and ate peach preserves and studied Billy Bunny's spelling list. 
    Billy Bunny and His Friends
    Carrot tea and lollypops
    Make small bunnies take big hops.
    But I really do not know
    If boys and girls would find it so!

    One morning, oh, so early, while the frost was still on the grass and Mr. Happy Sun was hardly out of bed under the misty hill in the east, Billy Bunny hopped down the pleasant meadow till he came to the babbling brook. Perhaps he wanted to see the little fresh water crab, Or perhaps he didn’t.
    I can’t really tell, for the first person he spoke to was Tommy Turtle. Yes, sir! Tommy Turtle in his little walk-about house.
    And do you know, I think it must be very nice to be able to take your house with you wherever you go, instead of having to leave it everyday.
    “Good morning,” said Billy Bunny and Tommy Turtle pushed out his head from under his shelf roof, for at first he had pulled his head inside, the way he always does when he hears a noise.
    “Oh, it’s you,” said Tommy. “I thought it was someone else,” and then he winked at the little rabbit in a very solemn way.
    “My, but it’s getting cold,” said the little rabbit, and he turned up his fur collar. “Willie Wind is as chilly as an ice cream cone.” And this made Tommy Turtle wink again, for maybe he didn’t like ice cream. But I guess he did, for in a minute he began to smile. “I’m going down to the Old Mill Pond. You won’t see me again till spring.”
    “What are you going to do?” asked the little rabbit.
    “I’m going to crawl into the soft warm mud,” said Tommy Turtle. “Old North Wind isn’t going to freeze the end off my nose.” And the wise little turtle started off for the Old Mill Pond, and when he got there, he flopped over the bank without another word.
    “Dear me!” Said Billy Bunny, “now he’s gone. Old Uncle Bullfrog is in the mud at the bottom of the pond and lots of the forest folk have flown south.
    “There won’t be many of my friends left before long.” And the little rabbit felt quite lonely. So he hopped away toward the Friendly Forest and soon he came to the stream where Benny Beaver lived.
    And there was that busy little beaver making his winter house of sticks and mud so that when the water froze he would be able to swim out through the cellar door underneath the ice.
    “Something tells me it’s going to freeze tonight,” he said to the little rabbit, “and I’m going to be ready, yes, indeed.”
    “Oh, dear,” said Billy. “Goodbye, Benny Beaver. I will see you in the Spring. And then Billy Bunny decided to head home. He was quite certain that his Mother and Father were also preparing their home for the cold winter. Maybe he should help. 
    The Nestlings

    Jolly Robin was a nestling, just eleven days old. He lived in a house in one of Farmer Gable’s apple trees with his mother and his father and his sister and two brothers.
    The house was made of grass and leaves, plastered on the inside with mud, and lined with softer, finer grass, which his mother had chosen with great care.
    But, Jolly never paid much attention to his home. What interested him more than anything else was food. From dawn till dark, he was always chirping for something to eat.
    And since the other children were just as hungry as he was, those four growing babies kept their parents quite busy finding food for them. Jolly Robin found he liked worms very much. And though he ate greedily of insects and bugs, as well as wild berries, he liked worms the best.
    Jolly and his sister and his brothers could always tell when their father or mother brought home some tasty morsels, because the moment the parent lighted on the limb where the nest was built, they could feel their home sink slightly, from the added weight on the branch.
    Then the youngsters would set up a loud squalling with a great craning of necks and stretching of their open orange mouths. Sometimes, when the dainty morsel was specially big, Mr. or Mrs. Robin would say “Cuck! Cuck!” which meant “Open wide!” But they seldom found it necessary to give that order.
    Somehow Jolly Robin managed to eat more than the rest of the nestlings. And so he grew faster than the others. He soon learned a few tricks, too. For instance, if Mrs. Robin happened to be sitting on the nest, to keep her family warm, when Mr. Robin returned with a lunch for the children, Jolly had a trick to play on his mother, which would move her off the nest fast.
    He would whisper to the rest of the children, and they would jostle their mother, lifting her up above them, sometimes almost upsetting her, so that she had to work hard to keep from falling off the nest. Mrs. Robin did not like that trick very much.
    The young nestlings grew so fast that soon they more than filled their house. As they grew larger, their parents knew it was time to persuade them learn to fly and leave the nest.
    One day Mr. Robin did not bring his children’s food to the edge of the nest and drop it into their mouths. Instead, he stood on the limb a little distance away from them and showed them a nice plump worm.
    The sight of that morsel was more than Jolly Robin could resist. He scrambled boldly out of the nest and tottering up to his father on his wobbling legs, he snatched the tempting morsel out of his proud father’s bill.
    Jolly was out of the nest and from that moment on he never went back to the nest.
    The next day Mrs. Robin coaxed the other children from home in the same manner. Jolly Robin’s parents were so proud of their nestlings, because they knew it was time they learned to fly. And, if they stayed in the nest and did not get up the courage to venture out, they would never learn the important feat of flying.

    Some of the feathered folk in the quiet pleasant valley said that old Mr. Crow was the noisiest bird in their neighborhood. But, I’m certain they were forgetting about Mr. Crow’s cousin, Jasper Jay. And it was not only in summer, either, that Jasper’s shrieks and laughter woke the echoes. Since it was his habit to spend his winters right there in Farmer Gable’s young pines, near the foot of Great Mountain, on many a cold morning Jasper’s ear splitting “jay, jay!” rang out on the frosty air.
    At that season Jasper often visited the farm building, in the hope of finding a few kernels of corn scattered about the door of the corn crib. But it seemed to make little difference to him whether he found food there or not. If he caught the cat out of doors he had good sport teasing her. And he always enjoyed that.
    Jasper was bold and rowdy but very handsome. And Farmer Gable liked to look out of his window early on a bleak morning and see him in his bright blue suit frisking in and out of the bare trees. Still Farmer Gable knew well enough that Jasper Jay was a rogue.
    “He reminds me of a bad boy,” Johnny Gable’s father said one day. “He’s mischievous and destructive, and he’s forever screeching and whistling. But there’s something about him that I can’t help liking. Maybe it’s because he always has such a good time.”
    “He steals birds’ eggs in summer,” Johnny remarked.
    “I’ve known boys to do that,” his father answered. And Johnny said nothing more just then. Perhaps he was too busy watching Jasper Jay, who had flown into the orchard and was already breakfasting on frozen apples, which still clung to the bare trees.
    When warm weather came, the rogue would fare better. Then, there was insects and fruit for him. And though, Jasper took his full fair share of Farmer Gable’s strawberries, currants and blackberries, he did him no small service by devouring moths that would have done harm to the grapes.
    But in the fall Jasper scorned almost any food except nuts, which he liked more than anything else. That is, if their shells were not too thick. Beechnuts and chestnuts and acorns suited him well. And he was very skillful in opening them. He would grasp a nut firmly with his feet and with a strong stab, split it with his strong bill. Johnny Gable could not crack a butternut with his father’s hammer quicker than Jasper could reach inside of a sweet beechnut.
    Though Jasper hated to spend any of his time during the nutting season by doing much else except eat, he was so fond of nuts that he always hid away as many as he could in cracks and crevices, and buried them under the fallen leaves.
    He was very much like the frisky squirrel in doing that. He believed in storing nuts for the winter. But, since he had no hollow tree in which to put them, it was only natural that he never succeeded in finding every one of his carefully hidden nuts. He left them in so many different places that he couldn’t possibly remember them all. Those that he lost often took root and grew into fine trees. And so Jasper Jay helped Farmer Gable in more ways than he knew.
    But no doubt Jasper would have shrieked with laughter had anyone suggested such an idea to him.

    Jolly Robin had just gulped down the fat worm that his father had used to coax him out of the nest.
    And now he clung desperately to the limb. With no food in sight he had plenty of time to look around. And he was very alarmed!
    The day would not be over before he had another great fright.
    Just then, Jolly lost his grip on the limb and tumbled out of the apple tree and fell squawking and fluttering to the ground.
    Luckily his mother went to Jolly immediately and told him, “Do not be afraid. Nothing will hurt you,” she said, “if you’ll only keep still. But if you squawk like that, the cat will find you.”
    His mother’s words frightened Jolly very much. They scared him so that he stopped making the noise. And that was how he learned the lesson never to talk when he was on the ground near a house where a cat might live.
    “Now,” said mother, as soon as Jolly was still, “I’ll teach you a new game. Just watch me!” She spread her wings, she flapped them and sprang into the air.
    Soon Jolly was trying to imitate her. And it was not long before he found himself gliding a short distance, skimming along just off the ground.
    But, in spite of all his efforts, he couldn’t help falling again and again. Though his mother tried to show him how to fly into a tree top, Jolly seemed unable to learn that trick.
    At last Mr. Robin said to his wife, “I’ll teach him the rest. You’ve made a good beginning. But he must learn more quickly. There is no telling when the cat may come into the orchard to hunt for field mice. And you know what would happen then.”
    His wife shuddered. But Mr. Robin told her not to worry. “I’ll soon have this youngster flying as well as anyone,”
    So he began to hop about on the ground with Jolly for a little while showing him how to find worms beneath the grass carpet of the orchard.

    And then, in a loud voice, Mr. Robin suddenly cried, “The cat! The cat!” And he flew into an old tree nearby.
    Jolly Robin had never seen Farmer Gable’s cat, but he had heard that she was a dreadful, fierce creature. And when his father shouted her name Jolly was so startled that he forgot he didn’t know how to fly. Before he knew what he was doing, he had followed his father right up into the old apple tree and perched himself on the low branch next to him.
    That was the way Jolly learned to fly. And as soon as he realized that he had actually flown from the ground to the bough of the tree, he was so pleased with himself that he began to sing merrily. And he never had the least bit of trouble about flying ever again.
    As for the cat, she was not in the orchard at all. In fact, Jolly’s father had not really said that she was. He had just played a joke on his son.


    In fact, that is how Jolly came upon his name. Until then, he hadn’t been formally named, but when his father saw how heartily his son laughed at the joke, he immediately named him “Jolly”. And Jolly he has remained ever since.

    If you a naughty act will do,
    You may at first escape;
    But soon or later you’ll get caught—
    So don’t get in a scrape.
    Featherhead was the worst pupil in the Shady Forest School and made lots of trouble for Professor Crow.
    One day he held a small piece of looking glass in the sunlight. The flash almost blinded the poor old crow’s eyes, and at first he couldn’t tell who had done it. But naughtiness will always out, and the next time Featherhead was caught.
    Yes, sir! The next time he tried it on Professor Crow, that old gentleman bird jumped down from the platform and took hold of that naughty squirrel’s ear. And not so very gently, either.
    Featherhead squirmed and tried to get away, but the good professor held on tight, and pretty soon the little squirrel grew very quiet indeed. He grew as quiet as a little lamb; that’s what he did.
    “Young man!” said Professor Crow in a hard, stern voice, “your father, Squirrel Nutcracker, is a dear old friend of mine. If it weren’t for that I’d give you a flogging.”
    Goodness me! When Featherhead heard that he trembled all over, and his beautiful bushy tail lost its curl and dragged on the floor like a piece of string!
    “You’re a bad lot,” went on the old professor bird. “You never know your lessons, and if you don’t mend your ways I’ll expel you from the school!”
    Gracious me! Think of having that said to you! Goosey Lucy’s little son, Goosey Gander, almost fell off the dunce stool, and Little Jack Rabbit was so frightened that his little pink nose trembled for an hour.
    Nobody played games during recess that day, but hung around in little groups talking it over. And you may be sure they kept away from Featherhead, who stood all alone by the flag pole wishing he hadn’t been such a bad squirrel.

    A mother and a father had a daughter who grew from a baby into a beautiful girl. The mother and father were very proud of their daughter, and one day the father said, ‘It is time you were married, my beautiful daughter.’
    And so it was agreed that the mother and father would travel to the next village to make arrangements with the family of the boy whom she would marry.
    When her parents were away, the honest girl began to daydream about what her life was going to be like with her new husband. And then she began to daydream about what it would be like to have children. And then she began to daydream about what her children would be called.
    She decided that she would have four children: three boys and one girl. She would call them Mulak, Jahaan, Dhesh, and Lutdi.
    She imagined what it would be like to call out to her children when it was time for them to come in for dinner. The girl was so absorbed in her beautiful daydream that she climbed up onto the roof of her parents’ house and called out… ‘Mulak, Jahaan, Dhesh, Lutdi!’ And as the honest girl called out these names, the people of the village all stopped what they were doing and turned towards the house where the honest girl lived with her parents.
    Then, one by one, they began to run towards the house because they thought that the girl was in trouble.
    You see, in Punjabi, the names Mulak and Jahaan also mean ‘people’. And the name Dhesh means ‘land’. And, although Lutdi is a name one might give to a daughter, it can also mean ‘I am being attacked!’ And so you might understand why all of the villagers began to run towards the house where the honest girl was standing upon the rooftop calling out the names of her imagined children… The villagers were afraid that the honest girl was being attacked!
    But even stranger, at that very moment there was indeed a group of thieves who were trying to sneak into the house where the honest girl lived. The gang of thieves intended to steal everything they could get their hands on because they had heard that the mother and the father were away in the next village and the girl was all alone in the house.
    But when the thieves noticed that all of the people from the village were approaching the house, they got scared and ran away into the surrounding woods never to be seen again.
    As the villagers arrived at the house, they called up to the honest girl. ‘What is wrong, my child, who is attacking you?’
    And the honest girl replied, ‘There is nobody attacking me. I was just calling out to my children.’
    ‘But you are not yet married!’ said one villager.
    ‘And you do not yet have children!’ protested another.
    The girl had great difficulty explaining to the villagers that she was simply dreaming about what her life was going to be like after she was married and had children. The villagers were not impressed at all. They accused the honest girl of daydreaming and causing trouble and not thinking before she spoke.
    But then a wise man appeared from behind the house and explained to the assembled crowd how he had seen a group of thieves running from the house, and how the villagers had scared them away and saved the honest girl from a terrible fate.
    He said, ‘Mulak and Jahaan are the names we give to our people. Dhesh is the name we give to our land. And when this honest girl called out to the people of her land, you all came. When she called out “Lutdi” you were all here to help her in her time of need. Does this not prove that you are all good people?’
    The villagers had to agree with the wise man, and they were all very proud that they had saved the honest girl from the thieves.
    Then the wise old man looked at the girl and said: ‘Perhaps it is also true that it is a good thing for a young person to daydream once in a while. After all,’ he said with a smile, ‘look what became of your daydream and how it saved you on this day.’
    Soon after, the mother and father returned to the village and the honest girl was married to her handsome husband.
    The years passed, and the girl did indeed become the mother of four beautiful children. She never forgot about what the wise man had said to her on that day, and she often reminded her children that is was a good thing for a young person to dream from time to time because amazing things come from dreams.

    Once upon a time, the dog and fox were good friends. They both shared a room at the house of a farmer, their master, whom they worked for as night guards. They were so friendly that they shared all secrets and spent most part of the night telling stories.
    One day, Fox came back with a rabbit. Dog asked him, “Great Fox, where did you get the catch?
    Fox smiled, and said “Dog, my friend, I know where the farmer sets his traps. Today it caught a rabbit. He has not been feeding us, so I felt this might serve us.”
    Dog said “Foxy, Foxy, you did the right thing. I am starving and really need the meat.” They both shared the meat.
    The second time, Fox came home with a pot of wine. Dog asked him, “Great Fox, where did you get the wine?”
    Fox smiled, and said “Dog, my friend, I know where the farmer taps his wine. We have not had anything to drink for the past few days, so I felt this might serve us tonight.”
    Dog said “Foxy, Foxy, you did the right thing. I am so thirsty and really need the wine.” They both shared the wine.
    The farmer had a pretty daughter who liked to play with Fox. She stroked his ears and groomed his fur. Dog tried to win the love of the farmer’s daughter over so that he could get groomed too. But the pretty girl didn’t like dog as much. Dog thought, “If I could get rid of Fox, I will be the only one in the farmyard. The farmer’s daughter will be forced to like me”
    While Fox went away to check the farmer’s trap, Dog walked up to the farmer and asked him, “Master, have your traps been catching anything lately?
    The farmer replied “No luck lately, I wonder.”
    Dog said, “Hmm, but Fox has been making great catches that we always had enough to eat”
    The next day Dog walked up to the farmer and asked him, “Master, have your palm trees been producing enough wine lately?
    The farmer replied “No, not enough lately, I wonder.”
    Dog said, “Hmm, but Fox’ palm trees have been producing a lot lately that we always had enough to drink each night”
    The farmer asked Dog, “Fox has no palm trees and traps, how did he get the meat and wine you mentioned?”
    Dog said “Master, I don’t know a thing. I am only a loyal guard to you. I don’t know where you either set your traps, or kept your wine pots. But I suggest you stand behind our window by midnight; you might hear something”
    At the appointed time, the farmer stood behind the Dog’s and Fox’ house. Fox came home with a bag of grapes. Dog asked him, “Great Fox! Where did you get the grapes?”
    Fox smiled and said, “Dog, my friend, just like the traps and the wine pots, I know where the farmer stores his ripped grapes. We have not had any fruits to eat for the past few days, so I felt this might do for us tonight”
    Dog said “Foxy, Foxy, you sure know all the farmer’s secrets. But I am full tonight.”
    Just as Fox settled down to eat the grapes, the farmer jumped out and hit his head with a big stick. Fox managed to rush out. He ran into the bush and never came back again.
    The farmer’s daughter hated Dog even more for what he did. She kicked him whenever he came close to her saying “You creepy Dog, what Fox did was bad, but betraying your best friend was even worse. Whom do you want to betray next to look good?”
    Dog lost his best friend, Fox, and didn’t get any attention from the farmer’s daughter either.
    Morals: Do not betray your friends to have your way. Whatever you do to others must surely come back to you.

    For many years all was well. Then one day their mother, the queen, fell ill and died.

    For quite a long time, the king was so bowed down with grief that he barely sat on the throne to run the kingdom. At last his Prime Minister shared with him that the people were starting to grumble.  They needed their king to rule as a king should, to settle matters and to make peace.

    Once upon a time, in a field not too far from you, there was an energetic and happy hare and a sleepy tortoise.
    The happy hare was called Noel and the sleepy tortoise was called Archibald. Archibald the tortoise liked to sit and munch his dinner slowly, whilst Noel the hare would gobble up his dinner and run round and round Archibald until he was dizzy.
    One day, they had an argument…
    “I am the fastest animal in the whole wide world,” said Noel. “I’m faster than a cheeky cheetah, a kicking kangaroo and a racing rabbit,” he boasted.
    “Oh do be quiet,” sighed Archibald. “You are so full of yourself! If you’re not careful you’ll come to a sticky end…”
    “Where’s sticky end then,” asked Noel. “Is it far from here?”
    Archibald rolled his eyes and carried on munching on some tasty lettuce leaves.
    “Oh you two do stop arguing,” said a blackbird as he flew past.
    “No, this is serious,” said Noel the hare. “I will prove to you all that I’m the fastest animal in the whole wide world“
    “OK,” said Archibald the tortoise. “I’ll race you then!”
    Noel the hare laughed his head off.
    “Just you wait and see,” said Archibald. “I’ll get Wallace the wise old owl to organise a race for us…”
    Wallace the wise old owl arranged the race for the next day. All the animals in the field put on their best clothes, groomed their fur, picked up a flag to wave and got ready to cheer the tortoise and the hare on.
    “On your marks… Get set… Go!” Called Wallace… And the race was off!
    Slowly, slowly Archibald the tortoise set off and quickly, quickly Noel the hare raced off and soon he was out of sight. In fact, he was so far ahead that, when he looked back, Archibald the tortoise was nowhere to be seen.

    “Gosh,” Noel thought. “I’ve more or less won all ready! I think I’ll just have a little nap under this tree, it’s such a hot day”. Noel the hare was soon fast asleep.
    Meanwhile, Archibald the tortoise ambled along slowly enjoying the sun on his shell and taking the odd nibble of grass from time to time. On and on and on and on and on and on he plodded. He plodded past the oak tree, he plodded past the bridge, he plodded past the cow shed, he even plodded past Noel the hare who was still snoring under the tree. He plodded on until he came to the finishing line where Wallace the wise old owl and all the other animals in the field were gathered. All the animals clustered around Archibald cheering and shouting:
    “Well done! Well done! You’re the winner!”
    All the noise woke Noel the hare up with a start.
    “Oh my! Oh my! What’s going on? What’s all that noise? Never mind. I’d better finish the race then I can go and have my dinner,” he thought.

    Noel the hare raced off down the hill towards the finishing line. But when he got there, to his horror, he saw Archibald the tortoise with a gold winner’s medal around his neck.
    “This can’t be right! He must have cheated,’ cried Noel the hare. “Everyone knows I’m faster than him!”
    “Archibald the tortoise didn’t cheat,” said Wallace the wise old owl. “He has won fair and square. Slowly and surely, never giving up, Archibald passed the finishing line first. Sorry Noel old chap, but you’ve lost this race. Let that be a lesson to you – slow and steady wins the race!”
    Noel the hare looked very unhappy and sulky. Archibald the tortoise felt sorry for him and tried to cheer him up…
    “Cheer up Noel, it was only a race,” Archibald said. “I’m sure you’ll win the next one. And I’d rather we were still friends than win every race under the sun.”
    And from that day on they became the best of friends and Noel the hare never boasted again.
    Moral; “Slow and Steady wins the race”.

Although Dionysus tried to dissuade him, Midas insisted that the wish was an excellent one, and it was granted!
    Excitedly, Midas went about touching all sorts of things, turning them into gold.
    Soon Midas became hungry. He picked up a piece of food, but he couldn't eat it, for it had turned to gold in his hand! \"I'll starve,\" moaned Midas, \"Perhaps this was not such a good wish after all!\"
    Midas' beloved daughter, seeing his dismay, threw her arms about him to comfort him, and, she too turned to gold! \"The golden touch is no blessing,\" cried Midas. He went to the river and wept. The sand of that river turned as yellow as \"fool's gold\" for it is there, they say, that King Midas washed away the curse of the golden touch with his own tears.

    Long, long ago the Jackal and the Dog were friends and lived in the bush. 

    They hunted together every day. In the evening they came home and ate their food together. 

    One day they did not catch anything and came back very hungry. A cold wind was blowing in the bush. 

    \"Oh,\" said the Dog, \"it is so bad to be hungry and cold!\" 

    \"Go to sleep,\" the Jackal said. \"When morning comes, we shall go hunting again and we shall catch a young antelope.\" 

    But the Dog could not sleep. Then he saw a red light far away. 

    \"Jackal,\" he cried, \"what is that red light over there?\" 

    \"There's a village and that red light is a man's fire,\" the Jackal answered. 

    \"Fire is warm and it is cold here,\" said the Dog. \"I say, Jackal, will you go and bring some fire? You are so brave!\" 

    \"No, no, I won't. You can bring, if you like.\" 

    The Dog did not want to go, because he was afraid of men. 

    But he thought, \"I am sure there are some bones near the fire. I can eat them. And the fire is so warm!\" He was so hungry and cold! Hunger and cold made him forget his fear and he said to the Jackal, \"I am going to the village to get some fire and some bones. If I don't come back soon, please cry Bo-aa, bo-aa! Then I shall know where you are and where I must go.\" 

    So the Dog ran to the village. He saw a hut near the fire. There were some bones near the hut. They were so good for the hungry Dog! He came nearer to the bones. But then a man came out of the hut and saw the Dog. 

    The Dog was afraid of him and cried, \"Oh, please, don't kill me! I am a poor Dog and I want to warm myself by the fire. Then I shall go back to the bush.\" 

    \"Very well,\" the man said. \"You may sit by the fire. But when you are warm, you must go back to the bush.\" 

    The Dog thanked him and sat by the fire. He was quite happy. He was warm and there was a big bone under his nose. 

    He began to eat it. And then the man came out of the hut and asked \"Aren't you warm yet?\" 

    \"Not yet,\" the Dog answered; he saw another bone not far away and wanted to eat it, too. Soon 
    the man asked again, \"Aren't you warm yet?\" 

    \"Please let me stay a little longer. I am not quite warm yet,\" was the Dog's answer. 

    Then the man came up to the Dog. The Dog looked into his eyes and said, \"Yes, I am warm now, but I don't want to go back to the bush. I am often cold and hungry there. Let me live with you in the village, please! I shall help you to hunt birds and animals in the bush and forest. And you'll give me some bones to eat.\" 

    \"All right,\" the man said. \"You may stay with me.\" 

    From that day on the Dog began to live with the man. And when you hear the Jackal cry at night Bo-aa, bo-aa, you know that he is asking the Dog to come back.

    But the Dog never answers and now the Jackal lives in the bush alone.

    Many moons ago there was a folk tale passed down from generation to generation. The story is about the Cho-Cho Man or the Boogie Man. It all began with a young boy named Dakota. Dakota's mother had asked him to gather some firewood for the evening fire. The nights were getting cooler. Instead of doing the chore right away, Dakota figured he had enough sunlight left to do two things. He would gather the firewood after he played with his friends Morgan, Joey, and Bo. Not long after, his mother began to wonder why Dakota never came with any firewood. Night had fallen fast and it was too hard to see the firewood. Dakota realized what had happened. He told his friends about his predicament and they said that they would help their friend. Soon after, the young boys were gathering wood in the dark. Dakota's mother was worried that something had happened. She went looking for Dakota. Not long after, she heard the boys. She had mixed feelings. She was happy to see Dakota but she was also mad that he hadn't listened to his mother. She wanted to teach Dakota and his friends a lesson so she sneaked into the bush very quietly. Then she picked up a twig and threw it. The twig hit the ground making noise. It caught the boys' attention. She threw another broken twig in the opposite direction. The boys jumped. The mother had a hard time holding back her laughter and a muffled moan sounded through her fingers. 
    The boys were definitely scared. But Dakota was the brave one. He ventured forward. The
    mother moaned again; she threw another twig. The boys were transfixed. Once more the mother moaned in a low and deep voice, \"Listen to your mother.\"
    The boys dropped everything and ran. The mother could not hold back her laughter and the boys, hearing this, scurried home even faster.

    After the mother had picked up some firewood, she proceeded home, where she found Dakota in tears. Dakota exclaimed, \"Mother, Mother I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.\"
    His mother held him with love and she knew that he was truly sorry. From then on when Dakota felt like not listening, the mother would mention, \"The boogie-man will scare you if you misbehave.\"

    The Lonely Dinosaur By Henrique Figora Many years ago dinosaurs were the largest creatures on earth. Some were very large and others small. They also came in many different colors. Behind the fiery mountains was a valley in which the dinosaurs spent the day. One sunny day the dinosaurs were playing a game of soccer. A new dinosaur that the other dinosaurs had not seen before came walking by. He stopped and watched and then he asked, \" Could I play too?\" All of the other dinosaurs looked at him. Together in one giant voice they said \" NO!\" The reason they had said no to him was because he looked different than the others. He had a long neck and he was green. None of them had ever heard of or seen a long necked, green dinosaur. The new dinosaur was very sad because everyone said no to him and they even called him 'Greeny'. His feelings were hurt. Slowly he sat down and sadly watched the others play.
    Time went by and then suddenly they all stopped playing soccer and they all looked up. One
    of the dinosaurs had kicked their only ball into a tree. The ball was too high for them to
    reach.

    But it was not too high for the long necked, green dinosaur. He walked over and said to the
    other dinosaurs, \"If I can get your ball down will you let me play with you?\" The other
    dinosaurs decided that it was a good idea. The long necked, green dinosaur reached up with
    his long neck and he easily got the ball down.
    Once again they began playing again. They had a great time playing soccer. The other
    dinosaurs said they were sorry for not letting him play with them and calling him names.
    They had all learned a lesson that day. Even though others may look different we should
    accept them. We all have something special about us.
    The lonely dinosaur now had many friends and they played in the valley for many more
    Years.

    Once upon a time there was a little boy named Peter. He lived with his grandmother. His
    grandmother went blind when she got older. From a young age, Peter had to look after his
    grandmother. He grew up to be a kind, gentle and patient person. He worked very hard.
    In Peter's country lived a king who was powerful and kind. The king had a daughter. His
    daughter was very pretty. The king worried about his daughter. He thought about his
    daughter every minute of every day. The king wanted his daughter to be happy and he
    wanted her to marry a good husband.
    As time went by, the princess grew up. She became more beautiful with each passing day.
    Her father, the king, thought hard about his daughter's future. The king wondered what he
    would have to do.
    One day he had an idea. He sent the news all over his kingdom and he sent the
    announcement to other countries too. The announcement read, \" There will be a special
    archery tournament. The man who wins this special archery tournament will claim the prize.
    This prize is to marry the king's daughter.\"
    All the people were excited. When Peter heard the news, he wanted to go to the archery
    tournament very much. He was very good at archery. He was so excited about the
    tournament that he couldn't drink and he couldn't eat. When he went to sleep, he dreamed
    about it. When he awoke, he thought about it. He was excited.
    At the same time he was sad, too, because he was so small and ugly. His grandmother
    asked him why he sounded so sad. All he did was sigh and answer, \"I'm okay;grandmother.\"
    His grandmother knew that he was sad and she asked him again and again.
    Finally he explained to his grandmother that he had heard the news about the king's
    tournament. He told her how he felt. His grandmother said, \"You are good at that game.
    Why don't you try it?\"
    \"I know I'm good at archery, but maybe some of them are better them me.\"
    \"Don't give up.\" his grandmother said, \"You can do it\"
    Peter said to his grandmother, \"But if I win the game, I don't think princess would marry
    me.\"
    His grandmother told him; \"It doesn't matter if she marries you or not. Just try to be as
    good as you can at the games.\"
    He thought for awhile. Suddenly Peter said \"You're right grandmother. I will try it.\"
    Peter trained himself. Soon he was ready for the game. On the day of the games he got ready to leave for the castle early in the morning. He wasn't happy about leaving his grandmother alone. He was worried about her. But his grandmother told him he had to go. Before he left, his grandmother gave him a red rose. \"After you win, give this rose to the princess. But before you give this to her, close your eyes and smell it's beauty. Be strong and be brave and win the game.\" He said good bye and left his grandmother and went to the castle. When he arrived, Peter saw the big castle. There were many people there. He was afraid to go in. Peter thought and thought. He almost went back to his grandmother and then he heard his grandmother's words again. Peter knew he could not turn back. He went across the castle's bridge and through the castle's large gate. Inside he saw even more people. There were soldiers all around him. He was so afraid. Everybody was excited about the game. Peter stood in line waiting for the game to start. He felt that everybody was looking at him strangely because he wasn't a prince or a knight or anyone important. The buzz of shopkeepers selling their wares and people talking and guessing who would win filled the streets. What kind of person was going to marry the princess? Would it be a knight or perhaps a prince? There were many excellent archers at the tournament. Peter nervously waited for his turn. Finally the judge called his name. Peter stepped forward. He placed an arrow on his bow. He pulled the string, aimed and released the arrow. It flew through the air and it hit the target. The crowd gasped. Peter looked and he could not believe it. Peter had been lucky. He had won the prize. Nobody thought that Peter was going to win.

    Slowly Peter walked to the front. He stood in front of the king and the princess. With his eyes looking down he offered the rose to the princess. But before he gave her the rose, he smelled its beauty, just like his grandmother had told him. Magically, Peter turned into a strong, tall and handsome man. Everybody was surprised, including the king and his daughter. Peter and the princess married and lived happy ever after.

He was a very bad chief. The people who lived in the village hated him, but they couldn't do anything to him. The poor people were forced to work in his fields. He paid them so little. They had to work all day long. The girl's mother had to be the chief's employee also. She too had to work all day long. When she got home she was exhausted. Most time she fell asleep as soon as she arrived home. Before the rich man had come to the village the girl's mother would take the girl on her knee and tell her stories. Now the mother never really had time to talk to her daughter. The daughter had not heard story from her mom for a long, long time. She missed these stories. She had not talked to her mother for such a long time. The girl felt pity for her mom. She knew that her mother was tired. But secretly she really wanted to hear a story from her.

The mom said, \"Once upon a time there were two brother birds that lived in a nest. They couldn't fly well yet. One day their mom went to look for food for them. A storm came. The wind blew hard. It blew so hard that the young birds were thrown from the nest and they were separated. One bird blew to the another country. There a gentleman caught him and looked after him very well. He grew up to be well education, gentle and kind. He had a good life. The other bird blew to the ground. There a bad man caught him and forced him to work.

    There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn not to judge things too quickly. So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away. The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in the fall.

    When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen. The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted. The second son said no it was covered with green buds and full of promise. The third son disagreed; he said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful, it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen. The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfillment.

    The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but only one season in the tree's life. He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.

    If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer, fulfillment of your fall. Don't let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest. Don't judge life by one difficult season. Persevere through the difficult patches and better times are sure to come some time or later.

    When passing through a mountain pass, a bedouin (villager) once came across an old man who was blind and who seemed to be afflicted with various ailments all over his body. It was clear that he was wasting away. He was even paralyzed and was constantly forced to remain in a seated position. The Bedouin could clearly hear him say, \"All praise is for Allah, Who has kept me safe from ailments with which He has tested many among His creation; and He has indeed preferred me over many among those that He created.\"

    \"My brother!\" exclaimed the bedouin. \"What have you been saved from? By Allah, I think that you have been afflicted with every single kind of ailment!\"

    \"Go away from me,\" said the old man, as he raised his head. \"Do I not still have a tongue with which I can pronounce His Oneness, and with which I can remember Him every single moment? And do I not still have a heart with which I can know Him?\"

    These words of the old man were enough for the bedouin to repent to Allah for his sins and ask Him for forgiveness.

    The Tale of Two Frogs
    A group of frogs were hopping contentedly through the woods, going about their froggy business, when two of them fell into a deep pit. All of the other frogs gathered around the pit to see what could be done to help their companions. When they saw how deep the pit was, the rest of the dismayed group agreed that it was hopeless and told the two frogs in the pit that they should prepare themselves for their fate, because they were as good as dead.

    Unwilling to accept this terrible fate, the two frogs began to jump with all of their might. Some of the frogs shouted into the pit that it was hopeless, and that the two frogs wouldn't be in that situation if they had been more careful, more obedient to the froggy rules, and more responsible.

    The other frogs continued sorrowfully shouting that they should save their energy and give up, since they were already as good as dead. The two frogs continued jumping as hard as they could, and after several hours of desperate effort were quite weary.

    Finally, one of the frogs took heed to the calls of his fellows. Spent and disheartened, he quietly resolved himself to his fate, lay down at the bottom of the pit, and died as the others looked on in helpless grief. The other frog continued to jump with every ounce of energy he had, although his body was wracked with pain and he was completely exhausted.

    His companions began a new, yelling for him to accept his fate, stop the pain and just die. The weary frog jumped harder and harder and - wonder of wonders! Finally leapt so high that he sprang from the pit. Amazed, the other frogs celebrated his miraculous freedom and then gathering around him asked, \"Why did you continue jumping when we told you it was impossible?\" Reading their lips, the astonished frog explained to them that he was deaf, and that when he saw their gestures and shouting, he thought they were cheering him on. What he had perceived as encouragement inspired him to try harder and to succeed against all odds.

    There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the flock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass. A little later when he lifted his head, the flock was gone.

    He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf. Then he started wildly over the field, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf!

    The Kid knew there was little hope for him.

    “Please, Mr. Wolf,” he said trembling, “I know you are going to eat me. But first please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.”

    The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily.

    Meanwhile, the flock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf’s piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf’s song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher’s trade.

    THERE was once a shoemaker who, through no fault of his own, had become so poor that at last he had only leather enough left for one pair of shoes. At evening he cut out the shoes which he intended to begin upon the next morning, and since he had a good conscience, he lay down quietly, said his prayers, and fell asleep.
    In the morning when he had prayed, as usual, and was preparing to sit down to work, he found the pair of shoes standing finished on his table. He was amazed, and could not understand it in the least.
    
    He took the shoes in his hand to examine them more closely. They were so neatly sewn that not a stitch was out of place, and were as good as the work of a master-hand.
    Soon after a purchaser came in, and as he was much pleased with the shoes, he paid more than the ordinary price for them, so that the shoemaker was able to buy leather for two pairs with the money.
    He cut them out in the evening, and next day, with fresh courage was about to go to work; but he had no need to, for when he got up, the shoes were finished, and buyers were not lacking. These gave him so much money that he was able to buy leather for four pairs of shoes.
    Early next morning he found the four pairs finished, and so it went on; what he cut out at evening was finished in the morning, so that he was soon again in comfortable circumstances, and became a well-to-do man.
    Now it happened one evening, not long before Christmas, when he had cut out shoes as usual, that he said to his wife: “How would it be if we were to sit up to-night to see who it is that lends us such a helping hand?”
    The wife agreed, lighted a candle, and they hid themselves in the corner of the room behind the clothes which were hanging there.
    At midnight came two little naked men, who sat down at the shoemaker’s table, took up the cut-out work, and began with their tiny fingers to stitch, sew, and hammer so neatly and quickly, that the shoemaker could not believe his eyes. They did not stop till everything was quite finished, and stood complete on the table; then they ran swiftly away.
    
    The next day the wife said: “The little men have made us rich, and we ought to show our gratitude. They run about with nothing on, and must freeze with cold. Now I will make them little shirts, coats, waistcoats, and hose, and will even knit them stout stockings, and you shall make them each a pair of shoes.”
    The husband agreed, and at evening, when they had everything ready, they laid out the presents on the table, and hid themselves to see how the little men would behave.
    At midnight they came skipping in, and were about to set to work; but, instead of the leather ready cut out, they found the charming little clothes.
    At first they were surprised, then excessively delighted. With the greatest speed they put on and smoothed down the pretty clothes, singing:
    “Now we’re dressed so fine and neat,
    Why cobble more for others’ feet?”
    Then they hopped and danced about, and leaped over chairs and tables and out at the door. Henceforward, they came back no more, but the shoemaker fared well as long as he lived, and had good luck in all his undertakings.

It took its own sweet time to go to the Lion. The Lion was getting impatient on not seeing any animal come by and swore to kill all animals the next day.
     
    The rabbit then strode along to the Lion by sunset. The Lion was angry at him. But the wise rabbit was calm and slowly told the Lion that it was not his fault. He told the Lion that a group of rabbits were coming to him for the day when on the way, an angry Lion attacked them all and ate all rabbits but himself. Somehow he escaped to reach safely, the rabbit said.
    He said that the other Lion was challenging the supremacy of his Lordship the Lion.The Lion was naturally very enraged and asked to be taken to the location of the other Lion.
     
    The wise rabbit agreed and led the Lion towards a deep well filled with water. Then he showed the Lion his reflection in the water of the well. The Lion was furious and started growling and naturally its image in the water, the other Lion, was also equally angry.
    Then the Lion jumped into the water at the other Lion to attack it, and so lost its life in the well. Thus the wise rabbit saved the forest and its inhabitants from the proud Lion.
